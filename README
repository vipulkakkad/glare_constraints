**Setup**

1) Run the `setup.sh` script, setting its permissions with `chmod +x setup.sh` if necessary.
2) Install the graph processing tools by the name of graphviz.

**Structure**

`plantri` is a planar graph generator created by mathematicians.
`pg2dot` is a formatter that generates graphs that can be rendered by graphviz.
`pg_constraint` is a formatter that generates MILP (mixed integer linear programming) constraints.
`pg2layout` is a solver that takes planar graph inputs and turns them into valid coordinate grids
